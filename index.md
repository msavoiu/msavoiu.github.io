### CPSC 120

* Lab 7
    
    I liked part 2 of this lab because I had to write a lot of different if-statements to validate parking on all the streets. I had to access the street names and hours from the command line and check the arguments against many different conditions. One part of it that was a little challenging was checking parking times for streets that had restrictions that were not to the hour, but I was able to do it successfully.

* Lab 9
    
    I enjoyed working on Lab 9 part 1 because I got more practice working with command line arguments, and also with moving through vectors. In order to calculate the judge averages, I first needed to figure out a way to loop through the different scores inside the vector and identify the smallest and largest values. It also gave me more practice with validating command line arguments.

* Lab 10
    
    Lab 10 part 2 was another favorite because it taught me more about two-dimensional vectors and how to retrieve and use/display different pieces of information inside them. It also helped me get better and writing for loops that move through the different parts of both one and two-dimensional vectors. In particular, I found it challenging but rewarding to have to figure out how to loop through the vector of counties and put only the county names into a string.
